<!--README: I did alot of reasearch on portfolio's but I really liked the look and feel of a fellow developers portfolio named Ludiflex. I was heavily insprired by their portfolio to make it the way I did. Even though I hand designed and programed it myself, I wanted too give Ludiflex credit for giving me the inspriation for making this portfolio-->
